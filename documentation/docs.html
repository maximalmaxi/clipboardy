                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <h2><strong>Please note that some of the guides aren't applicable due to the programm not being released
                        yet.</strong></h2>
                <p>Welcome to the Clipboardy documentation. This guide will help you navigate the features and
                    functionality of Clipboardy, along with tutorials on installation and contributing via GitHub.</p>
                <strong>Note: Installation assumes basic familiarity with programming and GitHub.</strong>
            </section>

            <section id="getting-started">
                <h1>Getting Started</h1>
                <p>This step-by-step guide will help you get Clipboardy up and running.</p>

                <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
                <p>To install Clipboardy, you’ll need the following set up:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Python (newest version)</li>
                    <li>Required pip dependencies (listed below)</li>
                    <li>The latest version of Clipboardy from GitHub</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Step 1: Installing Python</h3>
                <p>If you don’t have Python installed on your system, you can download it from the <a
                        href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">official Python website</a>. Make sure to select "Add
                    Python to PATH" during the installation process.</p>

                <h3>Step 2: Installing pip Dependencies</h3>
                <p>Clipboardy requires the following dependencies to work properly. You can install them all at once
                    using the <code>requirements.txt</code> file, found on GitHub, or manually:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><code>pyperclip</code> – for clipboard management</li>
                    <li><code>cryptography</code> – for encryption features</li>
                    <li><code>validators</code> – to validate URLs</li>
                    <li><code>customtkinter</code> – for a user-friendly interface</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>To install these dependencies using the <code>requirements.txt</code> file, wich you will need to
                    download first, run this command:</p>
                <pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
                <p>Alternatively, you can install them manually by running:</p>
                <pre><code>pip install pyperclip cryptography validators customtkinter</code></pre>

                <h3>Step 3: Downloading and Installing Clipboardy</h3>
                <p>Once you’ve installed Python and the necessary dependencies, head to the <a
                        href="https://github.com/maximalmaxx/clipboardy">Clipboardy GitHub repository</a> and go to the
                    "Releases"
                    section. Download the latest release of Clipboardy, unzip the files, and navigate to the src folder
                    in
                    your terminal.</p>

                <p>To run Clipboardy, use this command, or just double click <code>clipboardy.py</code>:</p>
                <pre><code>python clipboardy.py</code></pre>
                <br>

            <section id="features">
                <h1>Features</h1>
                <h2>Saving Clipboards</h2>
                <h3>Encryption/Decryption</h3>
                <p>All your saved clips (clipboard entries) will be encrypted for safety and automatically decrypted
                    when showing them to you. View the "clips.json" file in the "package" folder to see all your clips
                    in raw json as they are encrypted.
                </p>

                <h3>Auto Save</h3>
                <p>By toggeling the "Auto Save" switch in the buttom right corner, you can allow Clipboardy to
                    read and compare each of your clips to save them automatically for you.
                </p>

                <h3>Functions</h3>
                <p>Next to the saved clip in the main window are two buttons, the first one being for coping the
                    clip again and the second one to delete the clip. To delete all clips, press the "Delete All" button
                    in the buttom section.
                </p>

                <h3>Searching and filtering</h3>
                <p>The searchbar allows you to search specific clips by thier name. The filter function is still
                    in development and will be released soon.
                </p>
